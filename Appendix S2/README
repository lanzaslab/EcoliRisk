Uncompressed Appendix S2 .Rdata data files were too large to be included here (> 100 Mb). In order to include these data, the .Rdata files were compressed. Additionally, data2017_10secAgg was split into two separate data frames of equal length (i.e., data2017_10secAgg_1 and data2017_10secAgg_2). In order to use these data sets in "S2 Code.Rmd," users must first unzip the compressed files and compile the uncompressed data2017_10secAgg_1 and data2017_10secAgg_2 files back into the original data2017_10secAgg data frame in R.
